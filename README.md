## 1. Project Overview

The "Unemployment Analysis" project aims to analyze and gain insights into unemployment trends using Machine Learning techniques. Unemployment is a critical economic indicator that impacts individuals, communities, and entire nations. By leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, this project seeks to answer questions such as:

- What are the historical unemployment trends?
- What factors contribute to unemployment rates?
- Can we build a predictive model for unemployment rates?

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colaboratory for easy collaboration and access to powerful computing resources.
